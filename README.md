Hey! Welcome to my page, my name is **Jamal**

If you are looking for a specialist to create complex websites and highly loaded systems, let us be familiar!

I am engaged in web development, namely: layout, stretching, implementation of sites on popular (and not so) CMS, and also that I especially love sites/startups from scratch in php|python languages.

At the moment, on my account, the implementation of such large projects as:

- Creation and implementation of a testing portal Helitime.ru
- Creation and implementation of an e-learning portal Prolearning.ru
- Backend refactor of Olcha.uz
- Warehouse management system for the plant Maselko
- The system of testing and assessing the professional suitability of employees for Insurance Company "Alskom"

And also many more projects of varying complexity, which you can see in my portfolio or discover details on personal contact with me.
Judging from my page, it is obvious that I know 3 languages, at different levels:

- Russian (native)
- Uzbek (native)
- English (intermediate)

O! And also I sometimes dabble in development for Unity (mostly studying) and create web-view applications for Android OS but it's so self-indulgent.

At the moment, I am actively looking for an interesting job, if you are interested in my candidacy, you you can write to me, I'm almost sure we will find interesting solutions to implement your ideas, I have been for many years worked in Freelance, believe me I have experience =)
